# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the React application related to API error handling and DOM structure validation. The application currently experiences Supabase API errors (406 Not Acceptable) and React DOM nesting warnings that affect user experience and code quality. This spec will establish proper error handling mechanisms and fix DOM structure violations to ensure a robust and compliant application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper API error handling for Supabase queries, so that users receive meaningful feedback when API calls fail and the application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Supabase API call returns a 406 "Not Acceptable" error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging purposes
3. WHEN the user_groups query fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior to prevent application crashes
4. IF the API response format is incorrect THEN the system SHALL validate the response structure before processing
5. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix DOM nesting violations in React components, so that the application follows HTML standards and eliminates console warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AlertDialog components are rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure proper HTML element nesting
2. WHEN paragraph elements contain other block elements THEN the system SHALL restructure the DOM to use appropriate containers
3. WHEN AlertDialogHeader is used THEN the system SHALL prevent nested paragraph elements
4. IF DOM validation warnings appear THEN the system SHALL identify and fix the root cause in component structure
5. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL pass HTML validation without nesting warnings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the group management interface to work reliably, so that I can perform administrative tasks without encountering errors or broken functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the GroupManagement page THEN the system SHALL load user groups data successfully
2. WHEN deleting a group THEN the system SHALL show a properly structured confirmation dialog
3. IF group operations fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
4. WHEN group data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading states to indicate progress
5. WHEN group operations complete THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error boundaries and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unhandled errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture them with error boundaries
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log the full error context including request details
3. IF component rendering fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback UI to maintain application stability
4. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include relevant user context and application state
5. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable information
